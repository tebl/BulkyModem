# BulkyModem FA1
This is a faceplate, an inherently optional part of any build as it does not actually contain any active components. While it is my goal to keep these in a fairly universal format for the *BulkyModem* in general, getting everything redesigned to fit the same physical layout may not happen unless I find a fault that warrants a revisit. As for this specific design, it can **also** be used as the bottom part of the device, meaning two pieces are used when building the complete device. The following list includes a list of compatible projects, with compatible front faceplates listed directly below it:
- [BulkyModem](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/BulkyModem%20Module)
  - [BulkyModem FP2](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/faceplates/BulkyModem%20FP2)
  - [BulkyModem FP3](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/faceplates/BulkyModem%20FP3)

It currently looks like this:
