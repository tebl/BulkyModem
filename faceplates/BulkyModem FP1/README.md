# BulkyModem FP1
This is a faceplate, an inherently optional part of any build as it does not actually contain any active components. This faceplate mounts on the **front** of the device, and compared to the other options available, it is the shorter version [^1]. It is compatible with the following main projects:
- [BulkyModem](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/BulkyModem%20Module)
- [BulkyModem-32](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/BulkyModem-32%20Module)


It currently looks like this:

[^1]: This means that it does not extend below the main PCB when installed, any faceplates installed on the **bottom** of device will not be covered up. [Faceplate FP2](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/faceplates/BulkyModem%20FP2) is the longer version of it.
