# BulkyModem FP3
This is a faceplate, an inherently optional part of any build as it does not actually contain any active components. This faceplate mounts on the **front** of the device, and it is compatible with the following main projects:
- [BulkyModem](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/BulkyModem%20Module)
- [BulkyModem-32](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/BulkyModem-32%20Module)

It currently looks like this:
