# BulkyModem FB1
This is a faceplate, an inherently optional part of any build as it does not actually contain any active components. While it is my goal to keep these in a fairly universal format for the *BulkyModem* in general, getting everything redesigned to fit the same physical layout may not happen unless I find a fault that warrants a revisit. As for this specific design, it can **also** be used as the bottom part of the device, meaning two pieces are used when building the complete device. The following list includes a list of compatible projects, with compatible front faceplates listed directly below it:
- [BulkyModem-32](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/BulkyModem-32%20Module)
  - [BulkyModem FP2](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/faceplates/BulkyModem%20FP2)
  - [BulkyModem FP3](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/faceplates/BulkyModem%20FP3)
- [BulkyModem Terminal](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/BulkyModem%20Terminal) ^1^
  - [BulkyModem Terminal FP3](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/faceplates/BulkyModem%20Terminal%20FP3)

1) There are some markings on the underside of the PCB, but I suggest that you either put a sticker over it or erease it using a suitable marker (reverse the PCB when installing). If this is not to your liking, there's also [BulkyModem Terminal FA1](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyModem/tree/main/faceplates/BulkyModem%20Terminal%20FA1) that have been specifically designed for the terminal.

It currently looks like this:
